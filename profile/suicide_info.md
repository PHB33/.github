# Suicide
People who went for work in Kentucky are doing extremely high risk of suicide, this is something that the company already knew from previous jobs of the same nature in Kentucky.  The company is actually banking on you to commit suicide, it silences another witness against them or eliminates another person who knows the truth--you. Don't give them any goddamn thing like your life. 

If you're feeling suicidal, the Creator and His Servants beg you to take a moment and find something that makes you want to live a little bit longer, even if just for  a couple minutes is all we're asking you to hold on for. 

For me once it was my dogs. I literally had to think, "Who would come feed my dogs?"

# Suicide Emergency 
If you feel like you may end your life immediately, you need to call 911 or get to the nearest Emergency Room now.

In metro-Atlanta we recommend Piedmont Hospital ER (1968 Peachtree Rd, Atlanta). 

Northside Hospital (1000 Johnson Ferry Rd, Atlanta) and Grady have undisclosed relations with the CIA.

# Suicidal Thoughts 
- National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 800-273-TALK (8255)
- Crisis Text Line: Text Hello to 741741

Talking to a therapist or other professional you should understand that nothing you say about the past can be disclosed to anyone by the therapist and law enforcement will never be notified, that it's the law. For example if you say, "I killed five people yesterday." The therapist may ask you, "How do you feel about that?" in an effort to help you come to terms with it. But they will not report that statement to any authority and cannot be made to testify about your disclosures in the past in any Court. 

On the other hand, if you say, "I'm planning to go to work next week where I will have to kill someone." The therapist will have to report that to the authorities. They have to go to authorities because it potentially saves a life. 

You can also find a member of the clergy (priest or pastor) to discuss your thoughts on suicide. What is disclosed to a member of the clergy is generally never sought in court as the clergy historically never discuss what you talk about with them to nobody by God.
